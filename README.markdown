"ZeligNetwork" contains seven models for working with social network data.
Typical data-sets that work with these models are proximity (adjacency)
matrices.

The following models are included in this package:

* "cloglog.net" : a log-log regression for binomial dependent variables on proximity matrices
* "gamma.net" : a gamma regression for continuous, positive dependent variables on proximity matrices
* "logit.net" : a logit regression for binomial depebdebt variables on proximity matrices
* "ls.net" : a least-squares regression for continuous dependent variables on proximity matrices
* "normal.net" : a gaussian regression for continuous dependent variables on proximity matrices
* "poisson.net" : a poisson regression for event count dependent variables on proximity matrices
* "probit.net" : a probit regressino for binomial dependent variables on proximity matrices
